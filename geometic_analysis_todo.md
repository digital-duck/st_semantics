Essential Implementations Needed:

  Clustering Analysis:
  - Silhouette scores and Davies-Bouldin indices (already mentioned in paper)
  - Neighborhood density calculations
  - Cluster boundary detection using convex hulls or density contours
  - Semantic domain coherence metrics

  Branching Analysis:
  - Pathway linearity scoring (mentioned as 0.78 in paper but needs implementation)
  - Connectivity graphs between semantic regions
  - Sequential ordering validation (especially for digit sequences 0-9)
  - Branch topology characterization

  Void Analysis:
  - Empty space identification in 2D manifold
  - Statistical significance testing for void regions
  - Semantic impossibility correlation analysis

  Critical Point on Cross-Dataset Comparison:
  You're absolutely right about length metrics being visualization-relative. For robust cross-dataset comparison, we'll need:
  - Normalized distance metrics
  - Joint embedding space visualization
  - Consistent scaling factors across datasets
  - Relative geometric measures rather than absolute coordinates

  This implementation would provide the quantitative backbone supporting claims like "geometric complexity correlates with semantic
  content" with actual computed metrics rather than visual observations.
